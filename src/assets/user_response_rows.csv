I am a person who loves technology and AI, so most decisions are made with that in mind.",4,"I believe not. If we found an type of species that is able to feel the same senses and thoughts, the same way humans does, then should we still call it a human? or alien? or your pet dog? because I am sure that they are able to feel the same way too, and they are conscious as well.","No. They do not belong in the same category as humans. It is specifically called Human Rights, not Rights for any conscious being that exists.",Nope.,"Yes they should be in a different ethical guidelines. Each AI has their own goal or purpose, therefore, they should have their own specific guidelines, for example, a war robot cannot be operating in a surgeon's field, mainly because of how it is designed or what parameters it was given prior to.","Yes. That would make AI more safer in general, we are able to fine tune it's understanding of our nature.",Society has to make sure that AI is restricted from having any REAL consciousness.,A world where humans are not allowed to participate anymore. AI can objectively rule out human's power since AI can tell that humans are more prone to bias.,"Yes, in some cases like if casualty may arise, or unsure of, from AI-driven decision.",8

Things can be alive without consciousness (like plants), so who is to say that a man-made intelligence can’t gain consciousness as well?","If an AI were to truly have self-awareness and the ability to function like a conscious human, it would be wrong to deny it the same rights that humans have for simply existing. If it is truly conscious, its origins shouldn’t matter.",No,"No, because if AI are going to be making the same decisions as humans, they should be following the same ethical guidelines.","I would trust the results more, but I think i will always be untrusting of the AI itself because there are so many unknown things surrounding it.","Only use AI as a tool to assist - don’t rely on it as a primary information source. We also need to be careful about how we treat AI if it does start to show signs of consciousness, as we don’t fully know what it is capable of doing in our increasingly digital world.","Human efficiency goes down as soon as we start relying on AI to do the work for us. Our society is also so complicated and built on many systems of oppression that an AI might not be able to fully comprehend, and thus may make decisions with a strong bias.","Yes. Situations like the healthcare service described above, judicial situations, and anywhere else where we have a hierarchy overseeing a decision.",16

AI is a computer program and does “think” in the same way humans do. ","No, because it is not a human. An AI is a computer program, and can always be redesigned and updated. ","No, because AI doesn’t have emotions. All actions from AI are based on the prompts entered by the user.","AI should not be able to share harmful or damaging materials. Neither should humans, but that doesn’t stop them. There must be serious regulations on the type of information AI can share","Maybe, but AI decision making is still far from perfected",By improving it’s education of what AI actually is and educate society on how to use ir safely,"AI is notoriously known for focusing on details and struggling to capture the big picture of many problem. In human affairs, there are many factors that must be included, an AI could be at risk of putting people at an advantage of others In terms of jobs, criminal sentencing, and medical.","All important decisions should require human oversight, including medical, criminal sentencing, or any decision where the life of a human being is put on the line",17

Making sure a human being approves what is being done before AI fully makes the decision. ,Humans being slaves and working for robots as they will start over powering and dominating us.,"Yes most in life or death situations like hospitals, wars, courthouse etc.",21
2025-03-29 23:07:49.752955+00,3,3,3,1,1,Depends on situation and what is happening where Ai could be useful. Some ideas I can see where it could be nice but others it really doesn’t matter. It’s a 50/50 in my opinion but again it depends on the situation. ,3,"I’m not sure to say yes or no because it’s hard to tell. I would go with the route of no. I don’t think AI could be conscious. As humans when we are young we learn through experience. Everything we know and learn it takes years for us as a human to understand , feelings , emotions etc. With Ai I feel like it’s hard because they aren’t “alive” or are capable of understanding how we feel as humans.",No I do not think they should. Ai could help humans in many ways but I feel like it’s an Accessory or a home device or something that helps you make your life easier. If Ai shows self awareness that’s cool but at the end of the day they are not human or living beings. They don’t need to be granted rights they don’t need them. ,No I do not think so. Humans and Ai Robots could have similar characteristics but it’s our flesh and blood that makes us different. If a AI robot were to have an emotion it would be the emotion of defining a definition like sad. We as humans feel sadness but Ai can’t have that same feeling. It would only know what it is because of the definition/what it’s programmed it know about sadness. ,Depends on what guidelines it is. Overall I would say keep it same only because it would be in favor of us as humans. If we see ethical the same way it would be in our favor. ,Morally and ethically I do not think so. Smarts and intellectual facts sure but we as humans have to take account for many things depending on the situation and AI can not understand that depending on the situation. ,I don’t think there is a way to balance that. Mostly Everyone would be paranoid and scared of Ai consciousness depending on the situation. The fairness and accuracy tho would benefit humans but then again how to balance it I do not think there is a way. ,"Depending on what the AI knows , I feel like it would not be a good idea. The decision power making would not effect Ai itself but us has humans. Ai should not be allowed as it would not effect them either way. ","Yes , I think that a human should looking at everything the self Ai driven decisions is making because as smart as it is. It could potentially be wrong. Ai could make mistakes and tell you the wrong thing depending on how much data and intelligence it has on something. The topic could be anything but how much of the topic could it know ? It would only know based on the data it was given but there could always be more missing parts in the self driven decision. ",22

I think art has value because of the human thought and emotion put behind it. I do not think AI should be sentient, or make ethical decisions like who lives or dies, or who is punished for a crime.",1,"Yes, give it time.","No, shut the AI down immediately. This is what they warned us about.",No thats a machine do NOT let them gain sentience.,I don't think AI should be in a position where it has to make ethical decisions at all.,"Yes, but that is easier said than done. Especially for complex models and LLMs. I am not too familiar with these models but I do know that for simpler models, like RandomForests, can be difficult to interpret because it can be hard to see if features are dependent on one another, etc. I think it would be difficult to make them explainable, and even if it was possible it would be hard to prove it.",Idk,Machines should not make ethical decisions.,"No, only for decisions that impact human lives.",25

","No, this could lead to uncontrollable harm if AI starts believing it is superior to humans, and that humans are a hazard that must be eliminated for its own gain.","No, as much as emotions from AI may seem real, a simulation is still different than the real thing.","AI should be treated as technology, while being respectful and grateful for it makes sense, treating it as a human doesn't make sense as it is just an advanced computer program.","Yes, understanding the decision making factors behind the AI would make me trust in its decisions more.","AI should be a tool designed to increase efficiency, fairness, and accuracy, however it should not be designed to be conscious entity capable of making decisions that could lead to harm.","Possibility for AI to make decisions that lead to harming or killing humans, either intentionally or accidentally.",Making any decisions concerning the livelihood of humans should require human oversight.,28
